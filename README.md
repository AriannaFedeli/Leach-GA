# Leach-GA
This is a theoretical Node class, we made it to explain the Leach-GA algorithm to everyone, in fact the code is in Java.
There are many IT students that don't like read pseudo-code algorithm, for this reason we just made it.
We don't think that this class is ready to be compiled, we just want to show how the code works!
